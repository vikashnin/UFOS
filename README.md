# UFO Sightings with Javascript

# Overview of the Analysis
In this module, we were given a list of data that stored UFO's sightings. We had to use Javascript to display the data as a table and manipulating but adding filters so that it would be easier to look for the Country, State, City, and Type. We then had to place the table into a HTML file.

In order to perform a search, you would simply type the Country, State, City, and Type in the the placeholder elements and then you would click on the Filter Search Button.
