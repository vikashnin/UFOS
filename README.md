# UFO Sightings with Javascript

# Overview of the Analysis
In this module, we were given a list of data that stored UFO's sightings. We had to use Javascript to display the data as a table and manipulating but adding filters so that it would be easier to look for the Country, State, City, and Type. We then had to place the table into a HTML file.

In order to perform a search, you would simply type Country, State, City, and Type in the the placeholder elements and then you would click on the Filter Search Button. If you would like a more detailed search you can input multiple points into the the search bar. Once, you press enter, the results will be dispalyed on the right side of the screen.

# Summary
One drawback that might occur is that the user needs to know exactaly what they are looking for in terms of specific date. The first recommendation I would make is adding a section that we would be able to view news articles, or videos from that sighting. The second recommendation would be to add other countries.
